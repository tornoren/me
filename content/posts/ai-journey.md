ChatGPT shifts my mood. It fills me with optimism and causes me dread. Now everyone on the planet with a mobile device has access to an assistant like  Data from Star Trek.

But what may prevent this technology from turning on humanity? 

A machine only does what you tell it to do. That observation almost echoes the definition of a machine.

I fear what I don't understand. So every ~~week~~ time I have something to share, I will post an update of what I have learned and hopefully understood. 

The goal of any journey is to go through some kind of change. For better or worse: Here I come.
