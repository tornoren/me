The first lesson of the EDx CS50 course introduces key concepts related to the problem of search. For example, the solution provided by Google Maps for directions from point A to point B represents a search problem.

Assuming point A is your initial state and point B is your goal state, the available choices at any given state, such as point A, correspond to the actions. The outcome of the search problem depends on the state and the actions as inputs. Where you end up depends on what you do, and when and where you do it.

At some point, you will perform a goal test to determine if the current state is equal to the goal state.

These concepts are transferable to human life.
