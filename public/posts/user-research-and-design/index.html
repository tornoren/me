        <p>Twice I have had a falling out regarding the utility of user research. On those two occasions I have failed to build an understanding of my perspective. I encountered what I would like to call the value-free user research perspective.</p>
<p>This lofty ideal is alluring: We as design researchers can provide truth to the designers given enough time and money. But no-one can do this – and if some godlike person could give us a complete understanding of the user,  no-one would need it because that knowledge is only valuable to the extent that it may be related to the product.</p>
<h2 id="because">Because:<a href="#because" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no such thing as open inquiry - every investigation into the user experience is motivated by beliefs and ideas, no matter how shaky their grounding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is better to be open about one’s own presuppositions and ideas than trying to maintain the blank facade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want actionable insight that is easily shared within the team. There are specific questions that need answers. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio highlight your findings, forget the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interviews can give an initial understanding, interaction sketches may provide some feedback. But to gain a high-level understanding of the user and the design, you will need an interaction with a high-fidelity prototype.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clickable sketches seem like the easy way out, but they are a dead end street in the design process. Instead of building the product and get feedback along the way, you iterate on sketches by drawing more and more connections between them – creating design spaghetti. It may feel good, but you’ll only postpone important decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not need to test everything. Because user experience conventions work. Test as specifically as possible where you need help to make choices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So start guessing and get the feedback you need.</p>
