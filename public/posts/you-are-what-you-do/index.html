<p>Excel is an excellent tool for long-term planning in a low-res perspective in a rigorous | unflexible manner.</p>
<p>Word is good for producing longstanding documents that dictate the solutions long after the problems were forgotten.</p>
<p>Powerpoint is a great helper when you want to persuade or put your foot in the door. And many gatekeepers require a deck to say yes.</p>
<p>None of these are bad tools. Nor do they represent any malign influence in the world.</p>
<p>There is  some flexibility for you to choose right the tool when addressing a problem. But as a rule, the problem at hand determines what tool is right for the job.</p>
<p>So: Seek out the problems that require the tools you want to emulate.</p>
