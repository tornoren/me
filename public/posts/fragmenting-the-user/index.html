        <p>The user doesn&rsquo;t exist. No one conforms to this abstraction. Yet, it is useful.</p>
<p>Many discussions on design revolve around simplicity: How can we make this feature easier to understand, how can we make this product more intuitive, how can we simplify this design?</p>
<p>Adding multiple user types increases the number of factors exponentially. Complexity and competing priorities appear as a result.</p>
<p>Successful products are strategically mono-dimensional. The interesting question is not: <em>How many personas do we need?</em> Rather, the question you want to answer is: <strong>Who is my user?</strong> Allowing for some degrees of freedom with respect to demographics, computer fluency, and domain knowledge, are well within the bounds of the user as a device.</p>
<p>Trying to make everyone happy, is a losing proposition. Tearing the user down, will make everyone worse off.</p>
<p><strong>The user</strong> is a powerful construct that will help you move toward your product vision and help keep the team aligned. It will simplify most choices – for you and your users.</p>
