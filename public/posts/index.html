            A platform in this context refers to a group of sites that share important characteristics.
Important questions include:
Who are the users? What do they need? If we have several user groups, we should prioritize and make choices. Which one is more important? And can we help all of them?
We should also take note of their needs today as well as make projections for the future.
Drawing on the previous post I put forward that our data should tell us our state, our direction and provide us with the ability to extract sense from vast quantity of data.

            There are three key elements to a strong analytics setup. Whatever your system, workflow or software you need this needs to be in place. The essence is simple:
1. State Your data will not tell you what you need to know. You will have to instruct it. When you look out the window, you can tell what the weather is like. Your data should at first glance indicate how you are doing.

            Look ahead. There&rsquo;s always hope. There are always opportunities.
Don&rsquo;t get bogged down by the details. But set the course.
You cannot know all the things that may go wrong. And we often underestimate learning and creativity along the way.
So here&rsquo;s to full steam ahead.

            Resilience. Grit. Toughness.
Setbacks may bring major concerns. What doesn&rsquo;t kill you, does not make you stronger. They set you back.
Some will say you&rsquo;ll grow scar tissue, you&rsquo;ll become thick-skinned, you&rsquo;ll develop fortitude. But that&rsquo;s not the case. Instead, you will recognize patterns.
The next time you&rsquo;ll see the wrecking ball coming - and calculate its velocity. It will crush the building, but you will get out of the way.

            Whenever I want go deep, I am distracted by things “I need to do”. And that’s true: If I do not adress them, my work will suffer.
And whenever do I block out everything that is not related to the deeper task at hand, I am constantly on the lookout for fast decisions that require little understanding, but help me feel productive. In effect, that work dampens real progress.
But when I do succeed at working slow and coming up with a feasible solution to a deeper problem, I manage to reach decisions on other questions much faster.

            Someone said: First we shape our tools, then they shape us.
Excel is an excellent tool for long-term planning in a low-res perspective in a rigorous | unflexible manner.
Word is good for producing longstanding documents that dictate the solutions long after the problems were forgotten.
Powerpoint is a great helper when you want to persuade or put your foot in the door. And many gatekeepers require a deck to say yes.

            We all want fixes. We want simple solutions. We want someone to take away our worries.
But we do not want or need to understand how.
Because once we understand how, the magic disappears. The emperor has no clothes. It was a trick.
And the belief in magic keeps us going. It motivates us to look for the next technological fix. We all want to believe.

            The user doesn&rsquo;t exist. No one conforms to this abstraction. Yet, it is useful.
Many discussions on design revolve around simplicity: How can we make this feature easier to understand, how can we make this product more intuitive, how can we simplify this design?
Adding multiple user types increases the number of factors exponentially. Complexity and competing priorities appear as a result.
Successful products are strategically mono-dimensional. The interesting question is not: How many personas do we need?

            In our investigation of this we found no other way to present table of contents to help people navigate and read long medical treatment texts. We decided to go for a sticky TOC on mobile and smaller screens.
Having gone back and forth for some time on sticky elements on really long pages, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve learned:
sticky elements are annoying as a rule they should not be used but exceptions do exist So when do sticky elements on mobile actually help the user?

            In Gerry McGovern&rsquo;s book on top tasks he describes seven principles of effective digital navigation:
Momentum
Keep people moving forward
Unity
Make navigation as unified as possible.
Twins
Design for the journey customers are on.
Minimalism
Have navigation take up as little space as is practical.
Clarity
Navigation must immediately communicate what it is – and what it is not.
Fidelity
A link is a promise – navigation should keep its promises.
